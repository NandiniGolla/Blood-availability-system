# Blood-availability-system

Blood Availability System (BAS) is a browser based system that is designed to store, process, retrieve and analyse information concerned with the administrator, donor and a patient.
This project aims at maintaining all the information concerned to blood donors, different blood groups available in each location and help them manage in a better way.
The main idea of developing this web page is to provide the blood to the people who are in need of blood.
Using this web page a user can search for the donor list available in his/her own city who has the same blood group as user needs. 
And also using this webpage people can register himself/herself who wants to donate blood.
The requirement of the blood has to be requested by the acceptor if in case the blood they are needed for is not available and we supply the information of the donor accordingly.
